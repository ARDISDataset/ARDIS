I. Description of the Dat Sets

This paper introduces a new image-based handwritten historical digit dataset named ARDIS (Arkiv Digital Sweden). The images in ARDIS dataset are extracted from 15;000 Swedish church records which were written
by different priests with various handwriting styles in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The constructed dataset consists of three single digit datasets and one digit strings dataset. The digit strings 
dataset includes 10;000 samples in Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color space, whereas, the other datasets contain 7;600 single digit images in different color spaces.
